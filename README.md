# Arithmetic Formatter

Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. In this project, we create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function optionally takes a second argument that when set to True, displays the answers.
